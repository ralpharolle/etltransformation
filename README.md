Python Examination for Basic ETL Transformation

Activity:
- Extract and parse the attached CSV included in this email using python script and to some data transformation and new file creation.
- The CSV file contains the head fields (zone, sub_entity, raw_filename, file_size).
- Upon transformation the head fields above should be UPPERCASE in the new file output.
- Your script should transform the single example file into multiple files grouped by the unique entities in the CSV file. Ex. entities unique are CHLOE and Antony-PF.
- We should expect that your script will generate CHLOE file and Antony file csvs based on the example above with the same uppercase heading(ZONE,SUB_ENTITY, RAW_FILE_NAME, FILE_SIZE).
